# pokepredictor

**Summary**

PokePredictor is a Python toy I'm building to practice my Python skills and learn more about the use of APIs.

**Usage**

Type in the name of your favorite Pokemon to receive information about it, including comparisons to population statistics. Find out how your favorite Pokemon measures up!

**More Information**

Pokemon data is retrieved via PokeAPI, so that information on Pokemon from new generations (i.e., recent entries in the Pokemon video game franchise) will be available soon after that generation is released. However, the population statistics used for comparison are stored locally. Statistics are currently accurate up to Generation IX, with 1025 Pokemon included.

For further information on PokeAPI, please check out: pokeapi.co

**To Do**

-Find and sort more population attributes

-Map attributes to some categorization system (probably Big Five)
